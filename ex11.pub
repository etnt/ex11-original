{abstract,"This is an Erlang-X11 binding. Yes, that's right, a 
binding ! Not another interface to a toolkit. This is the X11
protocol implemented solely in Erlang. The release version
indicates how much of the protocol that has been implemented
so far (i.e Ver: 0.1 == 10%). However, this package also 
consists of a complete framework for the protocol implementation,
so the rest of the protocol would be very easy to implement.
(I estimate that the remaining 90% of the protocol could be 
implemented in 2-3 weeks). However, before anymore of the 
protocol is implemented it is suggested that we await the
new Erlang bitsyntax. A 'cool' example program comes along
with the package. <b>NB: ex11 is the new name and replaces
the old name x11</b>."}.

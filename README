NOTE: OBSOLETE CODE

THIS IS THE FIRST IMPLEMENTATION OF A SUBSET OF THE X11 PROTOCOL
THAT WAS MADE. IT WAS THE STARTING POINT FOR Joe Armstrongs ex11 LIBRARY,
WHICH IS A COMPLETE REWRITE. GO THERE IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AROUND.

ex11-0-11.tgz
===========

The package has changed name from x11 to ex11
to avoid any confusion. Also, a few changes
has been done so that it now should be possible
to run on Windows (assuming you have an X server).

x11-0-1.tgz
===========

This is an Erlang-X11 binding, i.e an implementation
of the X11 protocol in Erlang. At the time of this
writing about 10 % of all requests/events has been
implemented. The rest of the protocol would probably
only take 2-3 weeks to implement since a complete 
framework exists already. Anyone interested in helping
out with this should read README.developers. But before
anything more are implemented I suggest that we wait
for the new Erlang bit-syntax to be released.

To compile both for JAM and BEAM, run: 

  make

or just:  

  make jam
  make beam

if you only are running one of the machines.

Check out the code in rcube.erl for an example on how 
to use ex11. Run: 

  rcube:start(HostName),

where HostName is the name of the machine where your
X-server is running (e.g rcube:start("campari").
